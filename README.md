**statisticalColorAnalysis.py** examines the RGB color probability distribution in an image, revealing that this distribution can be effectively modeled using a three-variable normal distribution.

**radiometricTransformations.py** illustrates the impact of radiometric transformations on image statistical parameters.

**principalComponentsAnalysis.py** focuses on image compression using PCA.
